"""Configurable prompt/token budget for the persistent Nexus controller.

The persistent local controller previously resent the complete accumulated
task/discussion history and every previous tool observation on every turn,
so prompt size grew roughly linearly (in practice compounding, since the
observations were *also* duplicated through the persisted history view).
Left unbounded this eventually produces prompts large enough to have
llama-server killed by the Linux OOM killer.

This module keeps the budgeting logic small, dependency-free and unit
testable: it computes a conservative effective character budget from the
selected model's context window, reserved output tokens and available host
memory, then exposes helpers to deterministically compact/truncate
observations so a compacted prompt always fits inside that budget.
